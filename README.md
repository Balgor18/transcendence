# PongTheGame App
This project is about creating a website for the mighty Ping Pong contest.
It is based on the final team-project "ft_transcendence" of Ecole 42 Common Ð¡ore educational program.
PongTheGame App:
- includes user account and a real-time multiplayer online game;
- uses a PostgreSQL database;
- Backend is written in NestJS, Frontend - with React TypeScript.

## Demonstration
PongTheGame is a single-page Web App with responsive design:

PongTheGame provides user interface:
- Any user is able to login using the OAuth system of 42 intranet or Github;
- Users are able to choose unique nicknames, delete and upload avatars, enable two-factor authentication and check their match history and achievement.

But the main purpose of this website is to play Ping Pong versus other players.\
Users are able to play classic game with a random online player or invite a specific player to join customized game.\
Users can follow, block or invite other users and see their current status (online, offline, playing, preparingToPlay):

## Setup

### Foreword

There are 2 environments available: production and development. Each have a .env.example file which contains all the variables
needed for the services to start properly.

To use a specific environment (when deploying on a server, for example), copy the `.env.$environment.example` to `.env`.
To use both environment (when testing deployment on the development machine), copy the `.env.$environment.example` to `.env.$environment`. Switch between environment using the `setenv.sh` script like this: `./setenv.sh [dev|prod]`. `.env` will be symlinked to either `.env.development` or `.env.production`.

### Development

Because of the configuration merging, essentially everything in development uses the Makefile to interact with docker compose. In fact, the Makefile uses the command `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` to override the production configuration.

```sh
make                        # build and start

make build [c=container]    # build a container (all if `c` not specified)

make down [c=container]     # stop and remove a container (all if `c` not specified)

make ps [c=container]       # show the status of a container (all if `c` not specified)

make logs [c=container]     # show the logs of a container (all if `c` not specified)

make hc-logs c=container    # show the healthcheck logs of a container

make clean                  # stop and remove containers, volumes, networks and images

make fclean                 # remove everything created by docker (be careful, uses `docker system prune`)
```

Example .env for development

```sh
# .env.development

FRONTEND_PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT}
BACKEND_PORT=3080
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}

### Production

Use `docker compose` to interact with the production services.

```sh
# .env.production

# the server name used by nginx, for example "transcendence.bbrassar.fr"
SERVER_NAME=

FRONTEND_PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://${SERVER_NAME}:${FRONTEND_PORT}

# There is no BACKEND_URL environment variable because the backend is served by nginx, accessible at ${FRONTEND_URL}/api

# everything else is the same as dev envrionment
